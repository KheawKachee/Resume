        highlights:
          - Analyzed production data and translated insights into PLC control logic to improve operational efficiency ~10%.

    projects:
      - name: On-Demand Delivery Data Platform & Decision Intelligence System (Ongoing)
        highlights:
          - Designed an end-to-end data science system to predict delivery delays and support operational decisions, covering data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, and monitoring (Python, SQL, dbt, Airflow, PostgreSQL, Docker)
          - Built time-aware ML pipelines for delay prediction using engineered temporal, spatial, and rider-performance features; applied proper time-series validation to avoid data leakage
          - Developed interpretable classification models and feature analyses to identify key delay drivers (distance, zone mismatch, peak hours, rider workload), translating insights into concrete levers for ETA accuracy, rider assignment, and SLA improvement

      - name: End-To-End Football Player Value Forecasting & Similarity Recommendation System
        highlights:
          - Developed dual ML pipelines 1) Time-series regression to predict football players’ market values 2) unsupervised clustering to group players by performance style and role similarity.
