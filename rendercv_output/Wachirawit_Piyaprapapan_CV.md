- Implemented logging and monitoring pipelines, with daily system report and improving system reliability and observability in ML workflows (Python, Grafana, Docker)



## **Electrical Engineering Intern**, AGC Flat Glass -- Bangkok, Thailand

June 2024 – Aug 2024

- Analyzed production data and translated insights into PLC control logic to improve operational efficiency ~10%.



# Projects
## **On-Demand Delivery Data Platform & Decision Intelligence System**

- Designed and built a production-style data engineering pipeline with mocked datasets, supporting daily ingestion, ETL processing, and loading into a data warehouse (Airflow, Docker, Pandas)

- Performed EDA and business analytics on food order data, generating insights to support profit optimization and data-driven operational decisions (Ongoing)



## **End-To-End Football Player Value Forecasting & Similarity Recommendation System**

- Developed dual ML pipelines 1) Time-series regression to predict football players’ market values 2) unsupervised clustering to group players by performance style and role similarity.

- Scraped and engineered features to find insights from player performance and transfer data for exploratory data analysis.

- Performed data analysis and visualization to identify key trends, patterns, and drivers influencing player performance and market value.



# Competitions
## **I-squared Hackathon - Motorbike-Rider Annomally Detection and Classfication**

- Built a two-stage vision pipeline, YOLOv8 for human–motorbike detection → ViT for fine-grained classification.

- Built data-cleaning pipelines using a YOLOv8 detection model for automated correction and data enhancement.

- Reached semifinals with +90% accuracy on train images and +70% unseen real-world images.
